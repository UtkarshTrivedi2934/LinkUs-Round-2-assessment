Objective: Evaluate the provided code for the personalized book recommendation system.
To evaluate the code based on the following metrics:

1. **Accuracy**: Assess how well the model predicts user ratings. Look for metrics such as RMSE and MAE in the evaluation section of the code.
2. **Efficiency**: Evaluate the computational performance of the code. Consider the time complexity and resource utilization.
3. **Scalability**: Determine if the system can handle larger datasets without significant performance degradation. Look for any indications of the ability to scale in the code.
4. **Creativity**: Identify any innovative approaches or techniques used in the code. Consider the choice of algorithms, data preprocessing methods, and deployment techniques.
5. **Loopholes**: Identify any potential issues or areas for improvement in the code. Consider the robustness, error handling, and code quality.
