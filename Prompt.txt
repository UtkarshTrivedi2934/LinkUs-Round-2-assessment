My Prompt: You are provided with a Jupyter Notebook containing the code for a personalized book recommendation system. The system is expected to recommend books to users based on their reading history. Your task is to evaluate the code based on the following metrics:

1. **Accuracy**: Assess how well the model predicts user ratings. Look for metrics such as RMSE and MAE in the evaluation section of the code.
2. **Efficiency**: Evaluate the computational performance of the code. Consider the time complexity and resource utilization.
3. **Scalability**: Determine if the system can handle larger datasets without significant performance degradation. Look for any indications of the ability to scale in the code.
4. **Creativity**: Identify any innovative approaches or techniques used in the code. Consider the choice of algorithms, data preprocessing methods, and deployment techniques.
5. **Loopholes**: Identify any potential issues or areas for improvement in the code. Consider the robustness, error handling, and code quality.

Model's output:
Evaluation:
Accuracy: The model uses RMSE and MAE metrics.
Efficiency: The Surprise library is used for efficient collaborative filtering, but training time is not explicitly mentioned.
Scalability: The code uses SVD, which handles moderately large datasets, but lacks explicit handling for very large datasets.
Creativity: Standard SVD model used; Flask for deployment adds creativity.
Loopholes: Cold-start problem and missing data handling are not addressed
